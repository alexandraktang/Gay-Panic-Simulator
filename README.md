# Gay Panic Simulator
Gay Panic Simulator is a visual novel written and coded by Alexandra Tang (myself) and illustrated by Jessica Chu. <br />
The project was made for my Out in Tech's Youth Mentorship final project and created using Ren'Py.<br /><br />

This game was meant to familiarize myself with Python language and structure in addition to dipping my feet into non-linear narrative-based games / Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) games. Players can choose the main character's name in order to keep her more relatable and be a self-insert of sorts, and the game uses a point-based system that calculates the number of the different types of choices (Romantic, Friendly, or Antagonistc) to report to the player at the end.<br /><br />

I wanted to explore the relationship between two LGBTQ+ women navigating an awkward friendship while dealing with their own queerness. The player plays as Andie (or whatever name the player selects), a freshman in college with little sense of direction, and is able to choose different choice options while conversing with her childhood friend, Mel. The story deals with the simple awkwardness of reigniting an old friendship and accidentally stumbling upon a secret that concerns them both.<br /><br />

The player is "rewarded" for their choices by the reaction that Mel gives. This is displayed on both her face and in the words she may/may not respond with. As mentioned earlier, the game tallies the number of positive choices the player chooses and reports it at the end. Initially, this was going to play into different endings, such as a romantic end, a friendly end, and an enemies end, but as it felt rather unnatural, it was scrapped in the end.<br /><br />

It should also be noted that I wanted players to have the option NOT to come out to Mel, though Andie is canonically queer, as this is not something LGBTQ+ people should feel pressured to do even in a safe space-- it should always be their decision.<br /><br />

This project still has a ways to go and is certainly not a full game, but it is a stepping stone on the path to better narrative-based games that I hope to make.
